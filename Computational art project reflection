The installation of the extra software to create the images was very straight forward. My noise.png file was generated very quickly. Also part one was finished without too much work. 
On this project I still didn't work very strategicaly. I didn't start with making a small function that had the basic capibilities but directly made the big function and that is also why it took me a while to understand the assignment. 
Normally I am not really an art-lover but nevertheless, actually I enjoyed the project. I am very interested by the random factor in it. 
The project was perfectly scoped. Everything was clear with the knowledge we knew or could look up easily without having to learn to much by ourselves. 
I didn't really use a lot of unit testing because it was difficult because of the randomness, so there was no fixed answer. 

At last I found it a fun project because when I read it for the first time I thought that I would never be able to understand how to generate the random functions or how to analyse them and use them. But when I got into it, it is really nice to learn it.
